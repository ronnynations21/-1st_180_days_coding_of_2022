## Log of my Round or Challenge # 1 of #180DaysOfLearningCode - done in 2022

Note: Really i'm started seriously since November 2021, to learn Web programming for to convert myself in Developer Full Stack Senior and Data Science Engineer (This is my personal goal like Professional Programmer). When i was a young boy i began to learn programming in MSXBAsic, pascal, C and Assembly languages. I dedicated Aproximatly 30% of my life to coding. This is one big reason (between several) for i returned back to became in Professional Programmer in this season of my life (I'm 50 years old). I beleive never is to late for to begin something new or continue or recover an old dream.
