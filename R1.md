## Log of my Round or Challenge # 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2022

Note: Really i'm started seriously since November 2021, to learn programming for to convert myself in Developer Full Stack Senior and Data Science Engineer (This is my personal goal like Professional Programmer). When i was a young boy i began to learn programming in MSXBAsic, pascal, C and Assembly languages aproximatly 30% of my life. This is one big reason (between several) for i returned back to became in Professional Programmer in this season of my life (I'm 50 years old). I beleive never is to late for to begin something new or continue or recover an old dream.    

### Day 1: March 24. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time updating my github, reading about the program and post suggested by Alex Kallaway, who inspired me (between others mentors) to enrroll me in this 100 days to code. Also I'm started the training of Javascript in (https://www.codewars.com/kata/54da539698b8a2ad76000228/train/javascript). Also I continue studing other curses in HTL, CSS, Javascript and Python, than I started before meet the program of A.Kallaway. 

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.
